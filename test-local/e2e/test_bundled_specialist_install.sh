# Task 13 (specialist-bundled-plugins plan) — e2e: the ONE-FLOW bundled-
# specialist install (inspect -> consent -> commit) publishes an OWNED plugin
# registry entry (`<slug>.<name>` targeting `specialist:<slug>`) and the
# uninstall cascade removes exactly that owned set while:
#   - retaining the published artifact's bytes on disk (CAS/GC-root policy —
#     nothing here ever runs a sweep), and
#   - leaving a pre-seeded OPERATOR-owned plugin (no `owner` field) that also
#     targets the slug completely untouched.
#
# Harness mirrors test_specialist_install_from_repo.sh exactly (build_image/
# start_container/wait_healthy from common.sh; the internal admin unix socket
# for /admin/reload + /admin/specialist/status; a docker-exec'd python driver
# that monkeypatches ONLY the network seam, `specialist_install.resolve_and_
# fetch`, to copy the committed static fixture — everything downstream is the
# REAL production code: manifest/dependency-closure validation, the trusted
# source receipt (Task 8/10), the consent-identity tuple (component_id,
# version, slug, root_digest, receipt_digest — specialist_install_consent.
# install_consent_identity), the journaled bundle transaction (Task 10's
# commit_specialist_install/uninstall_specialist bundle=True path), and the
# CAS/registry/tuple writes).
#
# Consent is recorded directly via SpecialistInstallAckStore inside the
# container (the DM Approve/Deny keyboard itself is unit-covered by the
# specialist_install_consent tests) — this e2e's job is proving the real
# install/uninstall pipeline against the running container's actual
# filesystem + admin routes, not the Telegram tap.
