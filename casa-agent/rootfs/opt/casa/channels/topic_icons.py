"""Locked role → Telegram custom_emoji_id map for forum-topic bubble icons.

Evidence: 2026-05-13 live dump of ``bot.get_forum_topic_icon_stickers()``
from N150's bundled PTB (addon ``c071ea9c_casa-agent``). The "Topics"
set is curated by Telegram (~111 stickers) and rotates rarely; the IDs
below are stable. ``verify_against_telegram`` provides a boot-time
diagnostic that warns if any ID rotates out.

Bubble = role (set once at engagement open, never edited).
State (active/awaiting/completed/failed/cancelled) lives in the topic
title TEXT — see ``channels.state_emoji.compose_topic_title``.
