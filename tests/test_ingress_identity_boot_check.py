"""The ingress identity table is validated at boot (#203).

A route dropped from the table would send its ingress back to the
unattributed ``system`` identity — the silent degradation #203 exists to
prevent. The check must therefore run at STARTUP, not on first use.

It also has to run EARLY and UNCONDITIONALLY. v0.125.0 crash-looped production
because a boot-path defect sat inside ``main()``'s ``if telegram_token:``
branch, which no unit test enters; a check buried behind a channel condition
would inherit exactly that blindness.
