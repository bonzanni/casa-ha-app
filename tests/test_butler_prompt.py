"""Regression guards on butler/prompts/system.md content (B-2, v0.69.5).

Plain string-match assertions on the bundled butler (voice) system prompt,
mirroring test_assistant_prompts.py. The wording is load-bearing for
HA-tool-routing behaviour: a delegated "toggle office light" once looped on
GetLiveContext without acting (2026-07-11 ~23:50Z) because the prompt framed
GetLiveContext as a prerequisite for action and gave no anti-loop guard.
