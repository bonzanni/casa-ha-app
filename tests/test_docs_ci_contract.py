"""The docs CI workflow carries the sync-enforcement steps.

The sync property the corpus machinery provides: a PR that adds a substantial
module, an option, a tool, a route or an s6 unit goes red until the coverage
ledger assigns it; a PR that breaks a pinned invariant goes red in the unit
suite; a PR that moves a documented symbol goes red in the anchor check. This
test pins that the workflow actually runs the pieces — deleting a step from
docs.yml must fail here, not pass silently.
