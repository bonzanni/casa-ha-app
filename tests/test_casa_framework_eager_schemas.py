"""S-1 (block-S live finding 2026-07-15): eager schemas for casa-framework.

Claude Code ≥2.1.7 defers MCP tool schemas behind ToolSearch; since ~2.1.69
deferral is on by default regardless of tool count, and an explicitly
allowed tool is still deferred. On cold voice sessions the resulting
ToolSearch round-trips (each a full model turn) ate the 27s voice budget
before `delegate_to_agent` could even be called (cids ef8c68bb/8fff87ef/
93f501bb, N150 2026-07-15).

Fix under test: the casa-framework SDK MCP server config carries
``alwaysLoad: True`` — the CLI's per-server eager-load knob (shipped
v2.1.121 < our 2.1.150 pin; the Python SDK 0.2.114 transport forwards every
non-``instance`` key of an sdk-type server config to ``--mcp-config``
verbatim, `subprocess_cli.py:374-378`). The framework toolset is the small
always-needed core surface; plugin/HA/n8n servers deliberately keep
deferral.
