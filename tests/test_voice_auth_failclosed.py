"""#193 (v0.117.0): the voice external boundary is FAIL-CLOSED.

`channels/voice/channel.py::_verify` returned ``True`` when no
``webhook_secret`` was configured, so the SSE turn path (`POST /api/converse`)
and the WS upgrade (`/api/converse/ws`) dispatched UNSIGNED turns. The external
`:18065` nginx block proxies both, so with webhook auth off (the shipped
default) an attacker could POST an arbitrary prompt and reach the butler —
which drives Home Assistant. Sibling of the `/invoke` and `/telegram/update`
fail-closed treatments; the voice-agent catalog was already fail-closed.

These tests pin BOTH halves of the contract:
  * no secret  -> every voice route is refused (401), and
  * a secret   -> a correctly-signed request still works, a mis-signed one 401s
so a future "just make the tests pass" edit can't silently reopen the hole.
