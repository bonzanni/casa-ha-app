"""Entry-level reconciliation for list-of-named-entries config files (#398).

`config_sync.reconcile()` resolves divergence per FILE, byte for byte, so anything
an operator or an agent ADDS to a shipped config file is destroyed by an update
that also changed the shipped default. For the handful of files that are really
*lists of named entries*, the image's copy is a seed rather than the whole truth,
and resolution belongs at the entry.

These tests pin the two halves of that: the shape gate that decides whether a file
may be merged at all (and refuses on any irregularity rather than judging what it
means), and the three-way table that resolves each entry.

Spec: `config-entry-reconcile-spec.md` (private repo). Deferred: #402, #403.
