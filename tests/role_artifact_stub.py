"""Shared minimal RoleArtifactSource stub for unit tests that construct
AgentConfig/ExecutorDefinition directly (not through agent_loader.load_agent_from_dir
/ load_all_executors).

Personality Phase A, Task 6 makes ``AgentConfig.role_artifact`` and
``ExecutorDefinition.role_artifact`` required keyword-only constructor fields
with no default (see ``config.py``) — every direct-construction call site that
is not itself testing the role-artifact wiring needs SOME value there. These
tests don't exercise role_artifact content, so one shared, frozen, minimal
stand-in is enough; they must NOT reach into ``role_slot.materialize_role`` or
``role_artifact.load_role_artifact`` (which would validate/schema-check it).
