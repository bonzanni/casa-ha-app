# casa/rootfs/opt/casa/ingress_identity.py
"""Declarative ingress identity policy (#203 + #204).

Every EXTERNAL ingress — the transports a request can arrive on from outside
Casa — resolves its per-turn identity here, and nowhere else. The table below
is the single place that answers "who authored a turn that arrived this way?",
so adding an authenticated transport without answering that question is a
compile-of-the-mind impossibility rather than a silent degradation.

**#204 — attribution.** ``/invoke`` and ``/webhook/{name}`` used to stamp
nothing and fall back to the honest-but-blind ``system`` identity. They now
stamp distinct peers:

* ``/invoke`` → ``invoke_caller``
* ``/webhook/{name}`` → ``webhook:{name}`` (per-trigger)

They deliberately do NOT share a peer. Both are gated by an HMAC secret, and the
2026-07-10 operator decision that "the secret IS the trust boundary" governs
*authorization* — ``channel_trust("webhook") == "authenticated"`` is unchanged.
Authorship is a different axis: a shared bearer secret proves possession, never
that a particular human wrote the text. Neither peer is ever a human's. Naming
``/invoke`` inside the ``telegram:`` namespace would alias caller-supplied text
into a human's Hindsight document namespace (``content_document_id`` keys on
``user_peer``), so a caller could one day upsert over the operator's own memories
by echoing something they once said.

**The operator has no peer literal.** Every accepted Telegram sender — the
configured operator included — resolves to ``telegram:<sender id>``. What
distinguishes the operator is CLEARANCE, not the peer string: an operator sender
keeps the table's private clearance, any other accepted sender is floored to
public. The route used to name the operator with a hardcoded constant, which put
one person's name in a shipped default and made "who is the operator?" a fact
about this module rather than about ``telegram_chat_id``. Two consequences worth
knowing: the peer is now derived from operator-controlled configuration, so the
boot check can no longer compare it against a literal (it checks the NAMESPACE
instead — see :func:`validate_ingress_identity_table`), and the operator's
Hindsight document ids moved with the peer, since ``content_document_id`` hashes
it (a one-time re-keying, not a migration path).

Both automation routes yield ``speaker_kind="automation"`` (see
``speaker_provenance.UserProvenance.from_origin``) — honest about being
externally originated without claiming either a human author or Casa's own
internal authority.

**#203 — failing loudly.** The invariant enforced is "an authenticated ingress
stamps a ``user_peer``", NOT "an authenticated ingress names a human": voice is
``is_authenticated=True`` with ``authenticated_user=None`` by design (an
anonymous but trusted household speaker), so the latter would fail on voice at
boot. Enforcement is two-layer:

* per request — :func:`ingress_identity` RAISES on an unknown route or an
  unresolvable peer, so a handler cannot fall through to ``system``;
* at boot — :func:`validate_ingress_identity_table` fails startup on a
  deterministic table defect (a dropped route, an empty fixed peer, an
  unrecognized strategy). It is pure and directly unit-tested; the caller in
  ``main()`` is one unconditional line.

The assertion deliberately lives at the ingress boundary and NOT in
``Agent._process``. A "channel telegram ⇒ must carry a trusted origin" check
there would break Casa-composed internal turns that legitimately have no human
author — notably the post-consent plugin-setup dispatch (``_setup_dispatch`` in
casa_core, v0.112.0), which sends a ``CHANNEL_IN`` on ``channel="telegram"``
carrying text Casa wrote itself. Those correctly stay ``system``.
