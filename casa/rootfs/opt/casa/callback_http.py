"""The public ``GET /callback/{name}`` endpoint (spec §6; INV-CB-001/002/
004/005/006).

This is the authorization-callback facility's only unauthenticated surface,
and the only one an attacker can address directly. Three properties shape
every line below.

**One response, always.** Success and every refusal cause — unknown name,
missing/malformed state, unknown state, expired pending, replay, an existing
result, a write failure, an internal fault — return the *same* 303 to the
fixed, query-less ``/callback/done``. A differentiated status, header or
target would be an enumeration oracle: it would tell a prober which effective
names are routed and which states are live. That is also why there is no 429:
flood handling damps internal *emission* (below), never the response
(spec §6 step 1; INV-CB-005). Nothing on the request path can raise past the
outer guard, because a 500 is a differentiated response.

**Nothing query-derived is logged, and nothing request-derived is rendered.**
The query string carries a bearer credential (an OAuth authorization code).
Handler logs carry a reason enum, a cid and the *effective* name only —
except ``unknown_name``, which logs a fixed sentinel, since the route
component is attacker-controlled. The access logger suppresses the query for
``/callback/`` (see ``casa_core_middleware.QUERY_SUPPRESSED_PREFIXES``);
Task 9 adds the matching nginx ``map`` rule for nginx's own access log. The
two pages are static constants: zero interpolation of request data
(INV-CB-006).

One INV-CB-006 leak lives below aiohttp, on the ``aiohttp.server`` logger:
a request line over 8190 bytes raises ``LineTooLong`` *before* the handler
runs, and aiohttp's ``handle_error`` logs the exception at ERROR — the
exception message embeds the offending bytes, i.e. the query with the code.
:func:`install_callback_log_redaction` closes it: an idempotent
``logging.Filter`` on the ``aiohttp.server`` logger strips the query from any
``/callback`` request line in a record's message *and its exception
traceback* before any handler formats it. Casa wires it at app setup; the
residual is therefore closed in-container (the outer proxy's own logs remain
operator-configured, per §6).

**Opaque relay.** Casa interprets exactly one parameter — ``state``, parsed
strictly from the RAW query string, never the framework's decoded view, so a
percent-encoded or duplicated ``state`` cannot smuggle a different value past
the charset gate. Everything else is recorded verbatim (``raw_query``) plus
an ordered decoded view (``query``) for the consumer; no provider-specific
parsing exists here (INV-CB-004).

The route produces no turn: no ingress-identity row, no clearance, no
provenance. That is deliberate — a browser redirect is not an authenticated
principal, and the deposit is picked up by the plugin that minted the state.
