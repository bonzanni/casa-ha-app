"""Tarball install strategy (§4.3.1).

Security notes (v0.14.6):
- Tar/zip extraction is path-validated and symlink-rejected to prevent
  zip-slip / symlink-escape attacks. ``tarfile.extractall(filter=...)``
  is only available on Python 3.11.4+; production currently runs
  3.11.2 so we validate members manually.
- ``install_cmd`` must be an argv list (not a shell string). Pre-v0.14.6
  it was passed to ``subprocess.run(..., shell=True)``, which let any
  marketplace author execute arbitrary shell as root. Backwards-
  incompatible with any legacy entry that used a string; the first-
  party marketplace ships with no such entry.
- ``url`` must be ``http://``/``https://``. ``file://``/``ftp://``/etc.
  are refused so a poisoned marketplace can't read arbitrary host paths.
