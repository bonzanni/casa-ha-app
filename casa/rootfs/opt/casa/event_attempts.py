"""Plugin-event delivery-record bookkeeping — pure schema, envelope, and
schedule logic.

Leaf module (stdlib only, zero local imports). The plugin-events facility's
per-delivery ledger is the sibling of the callback facility's attempt
ledger (``callback_attempts.py``, read whole before touching this file —
its idioms are mirrored here): casa's durable record of every minted event
delivery AND the worker's read surface for the nudge sweep. This module is
the calculation half of that ledger: it builds, validates, terminalizes,
and schedules delivery records. It performs no I/O — the spool (a later
module) owns every read/write (marker discipline, atomic replace, the
spool lock); everything here is a pure function that returns fresh copies
and never mutates its inputs.

Three concerns, matching ``callback_attempts.py``'s structure:

- **Record schema**: the exact 15-key record (``new_record``), and a total
  fail-closed validator (``validate_record``) — a malformed file is never
  trusted; the caller re-derives it from live artifacts.
- **Mint envelope**: bounded fail-closed parsing of the pending-delivery
  marker payload (``parse_envelope``) — EXACTLY ``{"v": 1}`` is accepted;
  any other shape (extra key, wrong version, non-dict, oversized) degrades
  to ``None``. Unlike ``callback_attempts.parse_envelope``, there is no v2
  / ``meta`` channel at all — an event delivery carries no consumer-authored
  payload through this ledger, so there is nothing to echo and nothing to
  drop for forward compat.

- **Nudge schedule**: ONE set of offsets (0 s, 5 m, 30 m, 2 h, 6 h, 24 h),
  all anchored on the record's ``minted_ts`` — unlike
  ``callback_attempts``'s two-phase (result-then-outcome) schedule, an
  event delivery has no separate "result published" moment: minting IS the
  dispatch, so a single anchor covers the whole ladder. A total budget of
  ``MAX_NUDGES`` bus-ACCEPTED dispatches; an escalating capped deferral for
  a bus-REJECTED dispatch that spends no budget at all.

    NAME encodes its identity, and a grammar check alone would let a file
    read under slot A carry field values naming slot B — a record in the
    wrong slot is not a record. Bound here so no reader can forget to
