"""Delta-fed, tag-opaque prosodic splitter (spec §5.1).

Feed token suffixes via ``feed(delta)`` — it returns any blocks that
closed on this delta. Call ``flush_tail()`` on stream end to drain the
buffer.

Each emission is a :class:`Block`: the clean prosodic unit plus the exact
whitespace that separated it from the *previous* block. Blocks are handed
to TTS as independent utterances (where leading/trailing whitespace is
noise), but the same blocks are also concatenated back into one message by
the Home Assistant companion integration — so the separator that sits
between two blocks is real information and must survive the split
(issue #257). Carrying it on the *following* block, rather than holding a
finished block until its trailing whitespace arrives, keeps speech
latency unchanged: a block is still emitted the instant it closes.
