# (``disclosure.overrides``, ``tts.error_phrases`` values) as free-form
# strings — that authored-content surface is exactly what this check must
# cover. Raw-text scanning is deliberately NOT used here (unlike
# doctrine.md/persona content) because role.yaml's own flow-style YAML
# syntax legitimately produces adjacent closing braces (e.g.
# ``disclosure: {policy: standard, overrides: {}}``), which collides
# byte-for-byte with the forbidden ``}}`` template-close marker in every
# shipped role artifact. Scanning only the parsed string leaves catches
# every real injection surface (any string value the schema allows)
# without that false positive, and — per foundation review r3, F-A — is
# also immune to a marker hidden behind a YAML string escape, since it
# only ever sees the DECODED value.
